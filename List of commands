# This is a listing for major git shell line commands and what they do.

- ```git init``` -- initializes a directory as a repository.
- ```git add``` -- adds a file to the staging area ready to be committed. This can be said to mean tracking the file.
- ```git log``` -- shows a log of all commits that have been made.
- ```git status``` -- shows the status of the repository... all staged/tracked files are colored green, while the unstaged/untracked files are colored red.
